# COMP 283H Mid1 Truth Table Automation

In this repo can be found two files: [utils.gs](./utils.gs) and [functions.gs](./functions.gs), which were used to power the automated tables you can find on this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Er1lQO6p6tQV93_KAWSP9oODW57z_iA2QnhG4akYDmI).

[utils.gs](./utils.gs) contains the functions that define the code-translated h(w,x), v(x), universal (for all) quantifier, existential (exists) quantifier, and some utilities.

[functions.gs](./functions.gs) contains the 8 functions that represent the 8 logical expressions provided in Q2. They each take two parameters, W and X, which are expected to the be the set of words and set of letters, respectively.
